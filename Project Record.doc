-Prepare for data, separate them to the different vectors depend on the different features. Save the data to a new file "Original Data.mat"

-Check each data, check its type, range, max&min value, and choose the normalization method. Here I choose (x-mean)/std

-Write a function to make train and test data randomly. "RandDataBuild.m"

-Try to run the simply linear regression by the original data and normalized data, compare the result. (20000 samples)

-Find the features seems not totally independent, add some random Gaussian Noise

_-Find that the error rate of linear regression is extremely high

-Try to increase the number of training data and run the linear regression again

-Find that the error rate of linear regression is extremely high

-Check the training error
