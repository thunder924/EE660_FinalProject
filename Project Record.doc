-Prepare for data, separate them to the different vectors depend on the different features. Save the data to a new file "Original Data.mat"

-Check each data, check its type, range, max&min value, and choose the normalization method. Here I choose (x-mean)/std

-Write a function to make train and test data randomly. "RandDataBuild.m"
